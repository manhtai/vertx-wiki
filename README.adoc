== Prerequisites

* Apache Maven
* JDK 8+

== Getting started

Create your project with:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/manhtai/vertx-wiki.git
----

== Running the project

Once you have retrieved the project, you can check that everything works with:

[source]
----
mvn test exec:java
----

The command compiles the project and runs the tests, then  it launches the application, so you can check by yourself. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080.

== Building the project

To build the project, just use:

----
mvn clean package
----

It generates a _fat-jar_ in the `target` directory.
